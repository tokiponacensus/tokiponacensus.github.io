I'd say thats a huge part of why i enjoy it so much, because i feel like i belong here. Recently I was hit with a huge wave of depression and even contemplated suicide, but learning toki pona helped distract me for long enough to think with a clearer mind. I will be getting therapy, dont worry lol, but I want to express my graditude towards the community. I'd likely be dead in a ditch somewhere if it werent for all the wonderful people here. I'm nowhere near fluency, but I'll be striving for "conversationally suficient" for as long as I draw breath.

For instance, I rarely use ‹mije› and ‹meli›, and I don’t use ‹lukin› (instead, I used the pu synonym ‹oko›, in the pu meaning,  that’s why I put ‘know but don’t use’ under the question for ‹oko›).</li><li>sina ale li pona mute a!</li><li>I enjoyed learning toki pona, but ultimately I don't enjoy trying to navigate the community, which I find to be a bit of a social minefield. There's a certain attitude of "there are no rules, you can make your own nasin" that's popularized by some depictions of the language,  but at the same time, there's a cohort of "actual" speakers of the language/long-standing community members who have strong opinions about what is and isn't proper toki pona,  but at the SAME time, there's not much of a clear codification about what is and isn't this proper toki pona, and there's zero clear indication of who might be "authorized" to make decisions or speak for this "core community". It's like some people want there to be an agreed-on canon made by the people with a certain seniority in the language, but the general community setting's attitude of "there are no rules we're descriptivists do what you want" prevents any kind of formal recognition of such a thing. And I just don't enjoy trying to figure out such a quagmire, so I've mostly abandoned my interest in toki pona.</li><li>Click to add text</li><li>I’d like to have been able to distinguish reading ability vs conversation,  I’m much stronger in toki pona and French with reading than live conversation in both. </li><li>kurtoskalacs</li><li>What toki pona resources would help me? / A beginner hour in the evenings on the Discord. </li><li>133 or 127 depending from the angle</li><li>I highly appreciate the inclusion of Ithkuil and kay(f)bop(t) for the brave souls who dare say they speak it.</li><li>I am learning Esperanto</li><li>mu</li><li>Thank you, census organizers!</li><li>I am part of the ma toki pona VR group. the vrchat meetup group for learners and speakers of toki pona!</li><li>not sure of the transliteration of vietnamese / tiếng việt (sorry!), but i am a passive speaker (learning / know a bit ?) </li><li>I'd like to learn sitelen pona at some point/soon</li><li>A third option for people who knew toki pona on the first question would be nice</li><li>:)</li><li>Being developmentally neurodivergent the radical simplicity of toki pona is remarkably appealing.</li><li>I don't plan on purchasing pu or ku.</li><li>I have made friends in toki pona discord servers, although I have not met anyone that doesn't already speak english.

I've seen shit talk about toki ma, sitelen pona pona, certain nimi sin, and that one kana system.

I’ve seen a lot of interesting conversations in the Discord server about it’s importance to people and I think it would be neat to measure that in some way maybe.</li><li>Last year, there was this thing with separate analyses for people who chose to read the census in toki pona and those who chose any other language. it would be nice if this didn't happen this year, because it feels a bit discriminatory. i personally chose to use the English version of the survey because I know for sure it has been well tested and I vibe with English more than the other languages I am able to use. This is not a reflection of my skill level in toki pona.</li><li>sorry im high as balls rn i hope i answered rhe questions right</li><li>The “list of languages I speak” section is not nearly broad enough. Arabic has 490M speakers. 180M people speak Hindi. Wasn’t Included. Farsi has over 100M. Not there. almost 75M people speak Cantonese and it wasn’t an option. 10.5M people speak Swedish, which was included- and those other four weren’t? This is NOT a good selection of languages. (Sorry for the rant, but this should definitely be fixed next year.)</li><li>I would have liked to see a question on how head nouns are used instead of which head noun one uses, to know how many people believe "jan" to correspond to something like "person" versus something like "human person". I'd consider the former definition a more useful term, for example to distinguish between a soweli person and a soweli non-person, but I'd like to know how other people stand on this.</li><li>(learning Lojban, definitely can't have a full conversation in it yet lol but me taking this census la that counts as speaking it)</li><li>Need a "none" option for most of the languages list </li><li>no</li><li>Sorry, I had to romanize the endonyms for hebrew because LTR/RTL layout weirdness</li><li>I have only been learning Viossa for <1 month as of submitting on the 25th of September.

Maybe a transcontinental option or the ability to select multiple continents would be better.</li><li>i've been in this community for a year and it has grew worse. every chill person i knew has already left. consider this as my goodbye.</li><li>i'm gonna be honest, i used to be a lot more fluent in toki pona, but i forgot most of it lmao. i should really start relearning it</li><li>I just wanted to thank you for making the form/sorting through the answers, big thumbs up</li><li>ala</li><li>Too many sign languages.</li><li><3 Thank you for taking the time to organize and perform this community census! <3</li><li>I really enjoyed reading the results of last year’s census.

Also, I learned this language without owning pu or ku, but I hope to get both of them soon and improve my knowledge.</li><li>I'm surprised that the "What other languages do you know?" poll doesn't include Arabic.</li><li>I would like to see a question about "do you use toki pona for productivity?"

The main way I use it nowadays is with homework. For example, instead of writing in my notes, "because [A], there is [B]", I put, "[A] la, [B]". Or if I have a section about flora and fauna, I sometimes write kasi en soweli.</li><li>yoooo whats good</li><li>I first came to know about toki pona way earlier than I actually got to learn it in earnest. I think it was somewhere in the middle of 2000s. I was lazy to try it then.</li><li>I think one thing that would really help learners is a course similar to the Memrise one where each meaning of a work is quizzed. For example, for "laso", two cards would be in the course - one for "blue" and one for "green". This would help people reach fluency much faster in my opinion.</li><li>I am planning to learn toki pona</li><li>toki pona is really cool and has an awesome community. mi olin e sina mute a!!</li><li>Aspirations for the future of the language, such as sitelen pona inclusion in keyboard languages.</li><li>My knowledge of toki pona is steadily declining, because I haven't found a use for me.</li><li>Haven't really been able to practice toki pona cause eof everything, but interested in getting back into it. Excited to see the resources links,</li><li>This lipu gave me a cool list of things to look into (media, different kinds of luka pona, other conlangs...), so thanks!

(also many of the "other" toki pona words I included were mainly jokes that I'd use in very specific circumstances)</li><li>I'd like to think I "know" toki pona, but I often struggle to come up with the intended meaning when presented with toki pona text. I can translate all the words, and maybe give some possible translations, but I'm not ever sure that what I read is what was written. I kinda wish that this was allowed to be expressed earlier, where instead of a simple "Check what you can do," it was a "Check how much you agree with," in that way you would be able to see how confident people are with their answers. Maybe you could even do both, for two different ways of checking that statistic.</li><li>I believe that 'pona' is a larger philosophical concept rather than just the word for 'good, simple'</li><li>hello have a nice day:) sina pona a</li><li>I am technically a jan meli tonsi - a transgender woman, however the word "tonsi" also implies that I am nonbinary which I am not.</li><li>Perhaps some questions on disability would be interesting - that is, to see what links there might be between disability and the Toki Pona community. The same would perhaps be interesting with regards to what content creators respondents follow/consume - again, to discover any links that might exist between them and the community, whether they are Toki Pona-adjacent or not [in the case of the latter, the link would be purely coincidental. but interesting nonetheless].</li><li>I'd be interested in seeing what percentages of people have translated works. </li><li>toki</li><li>Toki Pona is an amazing language and has a wonderful community.

First of all, specifying/classifying the use of han characters to write toki pona into "Japanese" and "Chinese",  this does not at all reflect the cultural dynamics between languages in sinosphere. You might have meant specifically using kana along with han characters to mean japanese, but what if you use kana for grammatical words while mostly using the mandarin usage for the characters, because you couldnt find adequate words for them? Besides, because of the shared history of classical chinese (not the same thing as Mandarin chinese, surprise! Just like how italian is not latin) a lot of the times han characters don't even have to be representing a particular culture! This is what I usually do when I use han characters for toki pona, I intentionally pick characters that are used in all of east asia! Also, did you know that different chinese varieties exist? and that they use wildly different words from standard chinese aka standard mandarin? They have their own words and characters for those. Are those included in "chinese"? Also isn't it weird that you translated "kanji/kana" as "sitelen Nijon" in the toki pona version, because now it's ambiguous! Do you check it if you only use kana but not han characters? By the way "native/fluent" "can converse" and "learning" are NOT the only major ways one can interact with languages. I decided to drop mentioning so many of the languages I only know a little but am not learning because you did not consider that possibility.</li><li>We're a plural system, which seems to be a common thing in the discord. I'm kind of curious how common that is in the toki pona community.</li><li>im curious to know what percentage of jan pi toki pona are furries or nasin unpa/olin ante (since tonsi is already covered here), because it's definitely higher than the general population. </li><li>I wanna say that I find this interactions between the community so nice, just keep it up =)</li><li>Can I have a hug</li><li>i am 14 years old (i think that yous should have included more specific ages under 20, because i remember seeing at one point that like 40% of the tp community is under 18 or smt)</li><li>The language is called ‘Nederlands’, not ‘Nederlandse’.</li><li>kijetesantakalu li pona tawa mi >:3</li><li>Thanks for doing this census, I’m interested to see the results!</li><li>Toki Pona is such a beautiful language. I'm using it daily for fun and mindfulness practice. It's actually helping my mental health as well. Thank you!</li><li>The Toki Pona community is fun so far! I hope you'll do great and that the community will grow larger so that I'll have more people to converse with...</li><li>I wished you asked about number systems. Toki pona needs base10 counting or its completely impractical. One of the things holding this lang back.</li><li>Im very flex with toki pona word order, sometines changing places of different arguments distinguishing them only with particles like li, e, tawa, kepeken etc and even ”en” as a generic subject marker, even if it was a bit of a joke by sonja lang</li><li>I have the Complete Esperanto textbook, as I am planning to learn it in the near future. Also, I now kind of what to learn uwulang as a meme, because I just found out what that is and omg.</li><li>Thank you, this was fun :)</li><li>I would consume more toki pona content if it was easier to find</li><li>Just started learning! </li><li>sina pona li jan suwi :3</li><li>It is difficult to assess whether you know a word "including its non-pu meanings" seeing as the amount of said non-pu meanings aren't specified. Suppose I know two meanings of "oko" and thus answer "know", but there are actually four others in common use that I have no idea exist. This may result in inaccurate data.</li><li>You should ask about politics in the next census. I want to know common political beliefs in toki pona. Also like philosophical beliefs and stuff. </li><li>Idk man I was extra stoned at a bar so maybe I said more than I needed to lmao</li><li>A useful question would have been a general one addressing how open people are to using non-Pu words.</li><li>I really would like to see a Duolingo or Babel level learning course for Toki Pona</li><li>toki :^)</li><li>Where are the questions about *wanting to learn* toki pona?
I have been wanting to learn toki pona for maybe more than half a year by now, but I still have not had the time and/or motivation. I want to be able to write fiction in toki pona.
There is a question about owning the 'official' books. I do not have them. But not because I do not want them, just because I cannot afford buying them yet.</li><li>Toki pona sign languages are over simplified and thus hard to remember, so I am searching signs that  are somewhat same in finnish, swedish or american sign language and adressing those to toki pona words to be able to speak that with my friend</li><li>mi lon</li><li>wile sona pi toki luka la mi wile ken pana e ni: mi sona ala e lon pi toki ni taso mi ken wile kama sona e ona</li><li>mi o toki e ni: jan mute li lon kulupu pi toki pona. jan mute li sama. jan mute li ante. jan ale li sama ala. pilin mute li lon. nasin mute li lon. sona mute li lon. pilin en nasin en sona pi wan taso li lon ala.
