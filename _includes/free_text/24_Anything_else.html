I entered "not interested" for the one(s) I don't know/didn't make, but that doesn't represent my experience regarding those in my opinion.</li><li>In the question "What writing systems do you use for Toki Pona?", I felt it wasn't specified whether "know" means "I know of the writing system" or "I know how to use the writing system".</li><li>bro the community's so cool</li><li>这是一种新的开盒嘛🥰</li><li>molusa melome</li><li>when it doesnt create ambiguity, i almost always leave out the ni when chaining sentences together, as do some of my friends</li><li>We should strive to create a high-quality database of all the relevant toki pona writing systems, grammar books, courses, original content and translations...

I believe in the potential of the language as a communication tool and I also think it’s a fascinating piece of human culture and history- the ability to break language down to its bare essentials. I really want to learn toki pona, and hopefully I’ll be able to dedicate myself to learning it in the future. I’m especially excited about sitelen sitelen, I love aesthetically unique writing systems. </li><li>I believe there should also be a question on creating conlangs, as in “Have you created a conlang?” Answers being “Yes - Completion” “Yes - Growing” …

This could be helpful because it can show how much the creation side of the conlang community overlaps with the toki pona community. Most likely it will be in the 90%s, but it could surprisingly be somewhere in the 20%s, you never know.</li><li>luv you all ❤️</li><li>you gotta expand the community to not only english speakers! spanish and chinese speaker often give up bc there is no community in their language</li><li>ni li sama lipu owe</li><li>Feedback for "what other languages do you speak": there should be a "don't know" option in case you misclick, since you can't remove a vote there.

After few months of learning I noticed that it was the easiest language I've ever learned. Conversing about many topics wasn't a problem for me. However, when I'm listening to something complicated (for instance jan Kekan San's video "ale li nanpa") i don't understand all of the sentences.</li><li>I am a conlanger myself, I think it'd be an interesting question in a census</li><li>Would appreciate if you included more widely spoken languages in the language selection such as Bengali, Punjabi, and Gujarati.</li><li>k i j e t e s a n t a k a l u</li><li>i like how the previous survey did the word section more, however i have a feeling i'm probably in the minority of people</li><li>Toki pona is not so easy as it could seem ! After learning pu and with videos, the basis is clear and I understand a little written toki pona (on telegram's « kulupu pi toki pona »), but I find it difficult to construct phrases and to have sufficient imagination to find the way to express what I will, or to understand what others mean ! 
I have no experience speaking… but I'm fascinated, as for other minimalistics communication medias as morse code or braille !</li><li>lipu ni pona a</li><li>Neurodivergent</li><li>Neurodivergence (for scientific porpuse, of course)</li><li>mu a</li><li>These censuses are amazing! o awen pona <3</li><li>In the two questions where a specific 'format' was required it was not at all clear to me what the correct format was.

The census should ask about conlangs in the same format that is used for natlangs for if you're learning a conlang but don't speak it. Also I think that some of the tokiponizations in the language question are a bit questionable, and that the census should be availiable in more languages than just English and toki pona.</li><li>This language is so cool...</li><li>I'm helping my boyfrien learn toki pona, we are more than likely going to incorporate it as an important part of our lives because it's fun, though we want to make our own conlang someday</li><li>i wish to know more languages!</li><li>It should ask about being a furry and LGBT+/kule in general, and see how that compares to the people who identify as tonsi and head nouns.</li><li>i just ate 69 boogers /j</li><li>i make edits to sona pona la sometimes. someday i want to show off my translations/dumb jokes but unfortunately i'm shy and don't want to join a 10k+ member discord server to get bombarded with pings 25/7</li><li>i think the results should be made public to discords other than ma pona</li><li>i feel like not enough people take nimisin as unofficial slang :p</li><li>I started learning within the last week so my answers likely would be different for some of the questions regarding consuming/creating media since I have plans to and have not enacted them yet</li><li>As an autistic individual I feel that toki pona has helped me understand others communication styles more clearly.</li><li>Have a happy day! :3</li><li>tenpo mute la mi toki ala e toki pona. mi jo e tenpo la mi wile alasa e pona sona pi toki pona mi.

It gets me down every time I try to re-learn it that I can't produce sentences that make sense because of grammar issues. That's all really.</li><li>I don't toki pona super cool and I love the concept and the writing systems. The community is very pleasant as well and I love the shher amount of tutorials and documentation out there!</li><li>the "what headnoun do you use" section doesnt have a clear option for anyone with non-set headnouns/headnouns depending on context, and assumes that everyone has a set clear list they can enter</li><li>ale li pona</li><li>why wasnt linluwi in the question with majuna in it its just as common as majuna according to linku</li><li>kijetesantakalu</li><li>you should be more specific about location (i.e. separating contents into subregions)</li><li>august 8 (today) is international cat day</li><li>One thing I’m curious about is wether people that use Toki Pona invent their own nimisin?</li><li>soko li kasi ala a!</li><li>I sometimes have dreams and think in toki pona.

Many years later I knew jan Misali and the conlang community. In 2023 I decided I wanted to try learning it again so I bought pu and watched "12 days of Toki Pona" and worked through the book in parallel. I used a game called "nasin sona musi" on itch.io in order to practice the vocabulary.
Now I sometimes post on r/tokipona but apart from that rarely practice. I want to get on discord and start conversing but I'm shy and lazy.</li><li>I was banned 4 times from here because you are all a bunch of retarded autists</li><li>"i sometimes wonder what kekan's hands look like underneath the gloves" - wawie</li><li>hi! i've stopped learning toki pona for a while now, as i lost interest and started doing some other stuff. i don't know if i'll ever continue learning and eventually learn all of the words (all commonly used words, i guess), but toki pona still remains as something that is very cool!</li><li>I was surprised the form didn't mention local communities at all. The people I talk with with toki pona the most are the people around Montréal, QC through the east coast toki pona Discord server. I was even planning to go to an in-person meeting but I never ended up doing so. Discovering my local toki pona community is what made me want to keep learning when my interest started fading.</li><li>Best ways you are finding to learn,  cos learning can be hard when you are self teaching/not in school anymore, so that's why I'mnot as fluent in learning cos it can be hard to learn and finding a method that works best for my neurodiverse brain can be a challenge sometimes.</li><li>kulupu we!!!</li><li>shoutout jan Tesa their class was super useful, also I love love love sitelen sitelen</li><li>1. Toki Ma and Kokanu are listed as separate entries despite being (at least to my knowledge) the same language, the former just an older version. Though, I might be wrong.

2. Now this wasn't probably intended but I claimed to be able to converse in Norwegian (which is true), since my native language is Swedish and they are so similar. Just to be clear I have never studied Norwegian at all. Just wanted to let you know.</li><li>My favorite toki pona activities are the translation challenges on kama sona ( Discord ) that occur several times per week.
mi pona suli ni mi ante toki insa utala pi ante toki lon kama sona ( Disko ) ona li lon tenpo suli.</li><li>I haven’t heard of Chuff’s toki luka before (but now I’m interested),  I am currently learning sitelen sitelen</li><li>pona tawa sina!</li><li>I love that you included Kay(f)bop(t)</li><li>ale li pona!</li><li>Russian is my native language.</li><li>I would like for my word “posito” (respect) to be added to the list of words of Toki Pona. It is derived from the Macedonian word “pochit” (почит) which means respect. I don’t feel comfortable with using “olin” for respect.</li><li>no</li><li>Nothing else :) Keep up the good work 👍</li><li>Scots is listed between Irish and Welsh which makes me suspect somebody got mixed up between it and Scottish Gaelic</li><li>If I'm learning , it'd be nice to have that option to select for some questions.</li><li>For feedback, I guess it'd be interesting to collect data about how people use toki pona? Like if some people use it for talking to others or journaling for themselves or to translate stuff for fun. I guess there is a question for the reasoning behind learning but not really how it's mainly used by the people</li><li>kijetesantakalu, just, kijetesantakalu</li><li>sona nanpa ni li musi, sina pona!</li><li>t</li><li>ijo tan anpa nanpa</li><li>ni li epiku a!</li><li>pona tawa sina a! lipu pi jan ale pi toki pona o wawa a!</li><li>pilin nano pi toki pona li kama nasa. nano li wile pali e toki pona sin.</li><li>tenpo mute la mi wile pana sona tawa lipu ni. tenpo ni la mi ken ni a!! mi kama lape ala, li pana sona ni kepeken pilin pi pona mute.
