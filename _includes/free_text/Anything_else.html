<div class="scroll-tall"><ul class="free_answers"><li>I tried learning Toki Pona earlier this year, but forgot most of how it works, so my answers are kind of odd.</li><li>I'm a gay male and an anarcho-communist</li><li>Bees exist in all areas of spacetime.</li><li>I started reading the book, joined the discord, and promptly stopped studying the language or engaging in any media. I hope to start again soon.</li><li>I mean, I can put it anyways, but- no ala as default? srsly...
Also, I am median, but I'm not comfortable with plural addressing. This includes kulupu.
The main state is seli(syntropy)/jan/ijo/mije, as the shared identity is.</li><li>I run a Discord server where toki pona is at least text chatted and sometimes spoken.</li><li>the religion/philosophy question is inconsistent: it starts with words for people (“agnostic” and “atheist”), then there are words for religions (“christianity” and the others). i don’t like inconsistency but if you don’t want to fix it that’s ok</li><li>Political views would have been interesting to question</li><li>Love the surveys!</li><li>mi wile e sina li pona! (I’m meaning to say ‘I hope you’re well’ but I’m still learning)</li><li>My Facebook page: toki mi 2021</li><li>Perhaps a section on how you found out about Toki Pona might be interesting</li><li>The gender question is the only one where the divisions are drawn primarily by toki pona rather than in the language selected by the person filling out the survey. This can be (and is, for a few people I've shown the survey to) uncomfortable for trans people not in the toki pona community who do not know the history, nuance, and context of the gender labels presented and are often faced with difficulties when filling out gender in forms. I think it would be more fair to separate the toki pona from the survey-language (ie, offer both meli and woman, mije and man, tonsi and trans and nonbinary etc, ala and agender) to give people flexibility in their identifiers. </li><li>I would rephrase the question "how many language do you speak" to something else to be inclusive of ASL and other sign languages. Maybe "how many language do you know".</li><li>Maybe include a section about languages you are learning?</li><li>Well, I indicated all the languages that I have some knowledge of, even if the actuel knowledge varies. Dutch is my maternal language, English I learned through youtube and movies and I dare even say I am at a native speaker level. French I learned (and am still learning) at school. I am comfortable reading texts in French but I can't really converse or listen to it. German I am also learning at school, but since it is so close to Dutch I am comfortable speaking it, though I make mistakes once in a while. Spanish I am learning via Duolingo but I don't really count it as I haven't progressed very far. I would probably be able to find my way using broken Spanish but I would only be able to use two of the tenses</li><li>i find the implication that someone might learn to speak kay(f)bop(t) unimaginably amusing</li><li>I've been away from Toki Pona for some time, but plan on getting back to it soon.</li><li>I am learning toki pona very on-and-off, which is why I have known the basics since 2019, but can barely hold a conversation</li><li>jan misali very cool very epic very swag</li><li>I left some of the writing system questions blank because I /kind of/ know those writing systems but not well enough. In general, if I left something blank, I probably didn't know how to answer it</li><li>Since I don't talk to people in toki pona often, but use it mainly to scribble some sitelen sitelen in my notebooks, I can speak and write it much better than I can read and listen to it.</li><li>Didn't want to answer some questions in full for possible disclosure purposes</li><li>I would love resources for university students to start a toki pona club at college. While online lessons focus on individual learning, it'd be wonderful to have an instructional course for groups (with drills, conversational prompts and sample conversations, video or audio recordings, etc.)</li><li>I started learning toki pona but haven’t worked on it lately. I am also in the process of learning Hebrew, and I know a slight amount of Spanish, French, and ASL. I am not conversational in any of these languages.</li><li>I also use a slightly modified version of Canadian Syllabics for a writing system</li><li>I'm currently learning Japanese, Chinese, and Lojban (toki Nijon en toki Sonko en toki Lopan), but am not fluent in any. (I've been learning Japanese for a while, but I've just recently started Chinese, and I'm still reading the lojban book)</li><li>I like the structure of this survey, especially with the use optional sections and clearly worded questions.</li><li>suwi</li><li>fuck jan Misali skrr skrr
also I ain't tryna give y'all my email but y'all should release the results in a while because this shit is interesting</li><li>Right now I don't feel like I can remember much because I haven't done anything with toki pona in months, but I think if I did a refresher I might feel a little more capable of reading/writing toki pona.

My speaking level in Japanese is low conversational and in Chinese it's extremely basic, but I wasn't sure how to count how many languages I knew.</li><li>I have begun learning German, but I can't say that I speak it.</li><li>I actually don’t know much Japanese. I’m planning to learn it, though.
I’m probably in the middle of Beginner and Learner.
My pronouns are she/her and they/them. I felt like the census didn’t really ask about pronouns...

My Discord ID is Lilstar#1104</li><li>Everything's fine for me, but you maybe should expand your language question, you missed a lot of big ones as german, italian, wu, jin, swahili, ...</li><li>A thousand thanks to those who put this census together!!!</li><li>Im plugging my video "morshu translated into toki pona" because i wanna make more lol</li><li>I struggle terribly with formal language learning, but can get on passably if immersed.
I practice calligraphy, and appreciate non-Latin scripts.
I have attempted to make my own conlangs in the past.</li><li>unpa mama sina a a a</li><li>the asterisk in the question below was confusing, i thought for a while that it meant that my email would be posted</li><li>I started learning then got busy but I want to get back into it when i graduate uni</li><li>Why are the natlang Latin and the conlang Interlingua not cited as possible choices ?</li><li>mi olin e toki pona</li><li>I've created the toki mi conlang in 2019.</li><li>The community is becoming super toxic and divided based on personally world views. I come here for toki pins not LGBT content or political content. I'm sick of it. I have had to actively dissuade people from the sub because it has lost sight</li><li>As for the question about writing systems, I also write Toki Pona in the Gothic alphabet. Like, the extinct East Germanic language.</li><li>This section could ask for a range from “don’t know” to “fluent” rather than just yes/no. I am taking French in school, so although I wouldn’t say I “know” it, I could probably read some French.</li><li>I wished the questions were numbered. For the question "which of these is true for you" - none of them were true for me. "I know X" or "I can read X" etc is a broad whole statement. I think that question should have been on a spectrum, like most of the other questions were. For the question "which writing system do you use?" I wished there was an "Other" option, so I could have added sitelen ko, which was not on the list. </li><li>I'm not fluent in russian but I am conversational</li><li>I’m learning French and am somewhat able to hold conversations in it but not near fluent so i didn’t mark it as a language i know</li><li>Nah, all is good :)</li><li>pona sina li pona tawa jan ale :-)</li><li>For a lot of these I felt like I spoke languages enough to say I speak them but just just barely. For example, while I say I know toki pona and I am probably somewhere in between learner and intermediate. I would say ik toki pona at a 4/10 lvl. Similarly, I’m very bad at Chinese, and I was very much on the line about whether to count it as speaking it.</li><li>I am not fluent in any of the languages I mentioned knowing above, except English.</li><li>Your option for speaking French is wrong. It should be français, not Française—the language is masculin, so no e, and not capitalized</li><li>You could have asked for political leanings - but perhaps that would be a disaster...</li><li>Hi</li><li>there should be a question to judge how gay toki pona is</li><li>My answers are not congruent because I am learning/have been learning multiple languages over the years but really only speak English to a comfortable conversational level. Esperanto is my next best language, but I am very actively learning Latin also, and perhaps Toki Pona. I only started Toki Pona  a week ago, so can't say for sure yet.</li><li>I think it'd be interesting to include a question about political leaning/ideology.</li><li>Knowing peoples professions would be cool!</li><li>I'd love to be able to consume more entry-level content in order to improve my toki pona. I had a hard time finding quality audio/video resources of a beginner level.</li><li>I felt the Language questions were a bit all-or-nothing. e.g. I'm intermediate in Japanese so feel like I'm exaggerating saying I "speak" it. I've forgotten most but not all of Esperanto so left it off the list, even though I'm maybe still above beginner. </li><li>mMMmMmmM EIKNARF mMMmMM</li><li>i speak german and polish beside toki pona but ive only started a month ago and idk how to translate that into toki pona</li><li>i really appreciated the gender question, you asked it in a really good way :)</li><li>We are plural, and also interested in learning Esperanto, ASL, Japanese, and French.</li><li>nop</li><li>🦝</li><li>My languages other than english and toki pona are fairly weak.</li><li>This is a fun little language.</li><li>I think when I am speaking (or as of now just writing) Toki Pona, I feel more like a genderless happy penguin than in any other language.</li><li>blame jan Misali for me being here I promise I'll start properly trying to learn toki pona soon</li><li>In future, the region/continent question should either have an optional field if the participant answers "Other", or a field with suggested autofills (e.g. Africa, then Americas, then Asia, and so on if the participant types "A"). Besides this, having the Middle East and Indian subcontinent distinguished from Asia and Africa, but regions like
- Latin America and the Caribbean not distinguished from North/South America, or
- Melanesia, Micronesia or Polynesia from Oceania
is inconsistent.</li><li>Nah, all is good</li><li>:^)</li><li>jhnuitefrñ4aksdmlmrikoeñhltgnaszdvjm :)

</li><li>You probably don't know me. But when I was a young child I had a dream. And that dream was to work in the biggest factory in New York City. One day, aged just fourteen years of age, a man knocked on our door. He said that the factory was hiring. So I did what any entrepreneuring young boy did and took the opportunity.

The factory was tall and grey, and seemed to be from another world. As I passed the gates, I waved goodbye to my mother. Inside the factory there were long lines of workers at conveyor belts. Each worker had a machine beside them, and a set of containers. What were they working on, I wondered.

The answer soon became clear. As I looked at the containers closer, I made out the shape of countless books, each freshly printed and bound. My eyes followed the lines of workers to the far wall of the factory, at which point I felt a cold shiver down my spine. On the left hand wall of the factory, in angular industrial letters some twenty yards tall, was written just one word.

"pu".

My heart sank. This was it. I had been chosen to join them. This was their most treasured text. The Book itself. On the far wall of the factory, some seventy or so yards away, was a large screen, covering the entire height of the interior.

Everyone in the factory fell silent. The screen lit up with a person's face. The person began speaking in a language that seemed familiar to me. What was the language called again? it was hard to remember such facts these days. The powers that be had kept what could only be described as a low profile, if that phrasing wasn't so painfully ironic.

Such power over society yet most people barely knew their name, and the name of their language that was so central to their ideology. Something to do with talking, I thought. A few workers began to notice me, giving me disapproving looks. What was the name of the party? I struggled to remember. Something to do with "good", I knew that much. That was a key tenet of their ideology (which ideology doesn't have some definition of good?).

I began sweating as more and more of the workers began to notice me there, lost in my own thoughts, wondering who exactly these people were, who manufactured these books for the masses.

Our family could never afford them, of course, and my father was always very skeptical of them, saying that this was "literally 1984", whatever that meant. Some reference to an Old Times thing, I suppose. At school, we never directly read "pu". We discussed it a bit, but their ideology was more subtle,  you didn't need to state it bluntly.

I was most likely the only person in this entire building who didn't know the name of the most powerful group in existence. Some of the security guards had begun to notice what was going on, and began to head in my direction.

Sweating as I tried to recall the name, I looked back at the screen. I fell to my knees as I saw what was written. I now remembered it all, for on the screen was writen
