How is the Toki Pona community? Who is interested in Toki Pona? Up to now we could only guess but we were really as much in the dark as the character above. Fret not! You are about to see. 

April 23, 2021. The Toki Pona census is released. After about a month and a half it was closed with almost 1000 responses. It was made possible by a hard-working team. A big shout-out to everyone that helped make this a reality: the creators of the census (especially jan Sonatan, jan Olipija and jan Tamalu), the translators, people that suggested questions, the beta-testers and everyone that filled and shared the questionnaire a! tenpo ni la lipu sona ni li lon tan sina a! We want this: this flat of information feels good toward you!


<b>Things to know before jumping to the results:</b>

+ For every question there are two graphs. The first one contains results from all the responses. The second one contains the information from the people that responded using Toki Pona only. Note that the first graph includes the Toki Pona respondents too.

+ Some questions allowed to select multiple answers. Such questions have "<b>(MA)</b>" in its title. Take into account that, for those questions, the percentages of the bars add up to more than 100%.

+ All questions were optional, but the first one. Each graph tells the number of respondents for each question.

+ Free-text answers have been randomly shuffled, but they are grouped by language, following the order of the "<b>toki seme?</b>" question.

+ In small screens some labels could be hidden or incomplete. You can tap/click on the graphs to reveal the missing info.

# Intro

## Language used

Most people used the English version of the form. A bit more than 10% used the Toki Pona version. Some languages could have been used more but one has to take into account that some translations only came after the census was released (Chinese, French, Esperanto).

**Btw, [read this post]({% post_url 2022-10-15-musi-supa %}) if you are interested in a board game about language inspired by Toki Pona.**

## Sections filled

We allowed to leave the census after any section. Most people filled the whole form. In a couple of languages, the form was originally wrong so there were ~2-5 people that wanted to leave after some section and had to continue to the end manually. This issue was fixed promptly. These are the data of the sections that were filled

# Toki Pona ability

## Do you consider you know Toki Pona?
The form was made so anyone with any level of Toki Pona could respond (even if they heard about Toki Pona the day before, or if they were in the process of learning it). So perhaps not surprisingly, around 1/3 of people selected "No" for this question. But, of course, everyone among the Toki Pona respondents considers they know Toki Pona.

<div id="Would you say you know Toki Pona?"></div>
<div id="Would you say you know Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

## Toki Pona level
The level of ability varies a lot. You can spot sort of a normal distribution here. As expected, it is biased towards a greater level for people that responded using the Toki Pona version, with 85% of them saying that at least they can Toki Pona. And 24% said that they can express anything in Toki Pona.

<div id="What level of ability in Toki Pona do you have?"></div>
<div id="What level of ability in Toki Pona do you have?_tp"></div>

## How often is Toki Pona used?

The frequency of use also varies a lot, but around 1/2 of people use Toki Pona at least once a week. This was around 2/3 for people responding in Toki Pona.

## Toki Pona skills

## Why do people learn Toki Pona?
The main reason for learning Toki Pona was to have fun by learning it and using it. A perhaps strikingly 36% of people wanted to gain philosophical insights. Take into account that this question allowed to select multiple answers.

## When did people start learning Toki Pona?
Oh, this one is an exciting one. The data seem to indicate that the community is growing exponentially, doubling with each year. Part of this phenomenon could be due to the fact that people that learned Toki Pona more recently hang out more in the communities and have a much higher chance of responding the census. However, people have indeed independently observed an exponential increase in the number of people that are engaged with toki pona. For instance, this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/n3ucnp/lipu_wesi_pi_toki_pona_li_kama_suli_kepeken_tenpo/) shows the exponential increase in the number of people following the subreddit /r/tokipona. 

Around 79% of respondents started learning Toki Pona for the first time in 2019 or later. 2020 is more than twice more represented than 2019. Also, despite of the fact that 2021 is not nearly finished, people that started learning Toki Pona in 2021 are about as many as the people of 2020. A bit less than half a year passed when the census was closed, so it is expected that 2021 ends up having at least the double of the people that started learning in 2020. This growth is not so huge for people that responded in Toki Pona but still around 62% of people said they started learning in 2019 or later.

Below we have the same graph but in log scale. In this graph, a growth at the pace of a straight line means an exponential increase. One can appreciate how the data grow like a line since at least 2012.

# Community and Toki Pona

## Do people own pu?
Slightly less than 50% of people own pu. More people among the group of Toki Pona respondents own pu.

<div id="Do you own Toki Pona: The Language of Good by Sonja Lang?"></div>
<div id="Do you own Toki Pona: The Language of Good by Sonja Lang?_tp"></div>


## Non-pu words?
Around three out of ten people report using pu words only and around 2/3 say that they use a few non-pu words (non-pu meaning of kin, tonsi, kijetesantakalu...). The percentage of people using non-pu words was higher for the Toki Pona segment.
<div id="How many non-pu words do you use?"></div>
<div id="How many non-pu words do you use?_tp"></div>

## Teaching Toki Pona
People like to teach Toki Pona! Around 37% of people said to have taught Toki Pona to other people (100% minus percentage of people that responded with a "No").

## How people learned Toki Pona
<i>12 days of Toki Pona by jan Misali</i> gets the award to the resource that was used the most for learning. And by a margin. jan pona mi o, we are in the video era of the internet a! pu and jan Pije's course were used a lot by the respondents, too.  In the free text option, people indicated many things. The most mentioned ones were Memrise and Anki, which we have clustered in the graph. People mentioned to have used Memrise courses by jan Sonja, solpahi, and jan Kalupana.

<div id="How did you learn Toki Pona?_tp"></div>
{% include free_text/How_did_you_learn_Toki_Pona.html %}

## Communities
Discord and Reddit were the most represented communities, which makes sense because they are the ones with more people. Note the overlap is high among those two. Facebook, Telegram and Twitter follow.

## Particles - head nouns
Unsurprisingly, most people use jan as head nouns before their names. There is a non-insignificant number of people using other head nouns.

## Toki Pona media
Memes in /r/mi_lon were the most common Toki Pona media to be consumed, followed closely by Toki Pona songs and Toki Pona videos.  lipu tenpo and lipu kule were two other great sources of media consumed. Interestingly enough, specially taking into account that they are projects that were born around the same time, lipu tenpo was around twice as popular as lipu kule.

## Writing systems
As expected, regarding writing systems almost everyone uses and prefers to use the Latin alphabet. There was a significant amount of people that prefers to use sitelen pona. Maybe shockingly there were a few people that marked that sitelen sitelen is a preferred/greatly used option. It seems that sitelen Emoji is almost as widely known as sitelen sitelen. Note that some people responded to some of these questions only and not to others. The length of each bar differs a bit, indicating the total number of respondents for each option.

## Age
Around half of the people responding were under 20, and around a third are in their 20s. Note that most bars specify a range of 10 years but we asked about the 20s by using two ranges. Interestingly, people that responded using Toki Pona tend to be older.

<div id="How old are you?"></div>
<div id="How old are you?_tp"></div>

## Region

Around half of the people responding are from North America and around one third are from Europe. The next most represented regions were Asia, Oceania and South America. This doesn't mean an overwhelming majority of people that know Toki Pona live in North America or Europe, just that the respondents were from these places.

<div id="What continent/region are you from? "></div>
<div id="What continent/region are you from? _tp"></div>

## Gender
Perhaps surprisingly, more people reported their gender is tonsi than people specifying meli. There were many more mije than anything else. Note this was a multiple answer question so the percentages add up to more than 100%.


<div id="What is your gender?"></div>
<div id="What is your gender?_tp"></div>

## Religion
Atheism and Agnosticism were the most selected answers in the religion/philosophy question, adding up to around 3 out of 4 people.

# Languages

## How many languages do tokiponists know?
Around 50% of the people reported to know 3 or 4 languages (including Toki Pona). Around 5% said they know 7 or more languages, some of which could be other conlangs. In the spirit of Toki Pona, this was an ambiguous question and it was up to interpretation from the respondents to decide what it was meant by "knowing a language". Some people suggested after the fact that we should have had a way to make this more granular, allowing to specify which languages you know very well and which ones you are learning. That's a good point to take into account if this census is done again in a few years. You can also spot here how things concentrate towards a normal (or beta?) distribution. The Toki Pona chart is not so regular, possibly due to the reduced number of data points.

<div id="How many languages do you know? (including Toki Pona)"></div>
<div id="How many languages do you know? (including Toki Pona)_tp"></div>

## What languages do tokiponists know? 

The original options of this question were chosen to be the languages that were spoken the most around the world. People could indicate other languages that they knew. For this graph, we used our originally provided answers and we also included languages that were mentioned with some frequency. Sorry if your language is not in the chart, in that case it appears below. Some people included several languages in this field, so we split them by commas and extracted the most common languages. The remaining parts of the answer are shown below the graphs. Some answers might sound weird because we removed the extracted data that was used for the graphs. The next question was about conlangs specifically, but some people replied with some conlangs in here. We have clustered them anyway too so the free-answer section is cleaner.

Almost every respondent reports to know English. There is a great variety of languages represented here.

## What conlangs do tokiponists know? 
Perhaps not surprisingly, a significant amount of people (around one out of three) knows at least another conlang besides Toki Pona. Esperanto being the most common one.

# Free-answer section

We asked people to add anything else they wanted and we received quite a few answers. Some of them were feedback about the form, that was updated in real time while the census was running. Thanks everyone for participating and special thanks to those providing feedback!
