How much has the Toki Pona community changed since April 2021? Is it still growing exponentially? Are Ku suli words known or used? Find about this and much more in the results to the second Toki Pona census, version 2022. 

August 27, 2022. After 1 year and 4 months since the first census, this second one is released. After 6 weeks, about the same time as for the previous census, it was closed with almost 2000 responses. Twice as many!

Hi, I'm jan Tamalu and I have coordinated this project, analyzed the data and made this website. This year we made some extra efforts to reach to people outside of the big communities. We did this by adding more translations to the form and by having a second form on a platform that could be used from mainland China. Some questions are new, like the one about the knowledge and usage of non-pu words. Some other questions changed, like the one about the languages that you speak, for which this time we asked about the level as well.

Thank you to everyone that contributed to this project. o lukin pona a!


<b>What to know before jumping to the results:</b>

+ For every question there are two graphs. The first one contains results from all the responses. The second one contains the information from the people that responded using Toki Pona only. Note that the first graph includes the Toki Pona respondents too.

+ Some questions allowed to select multiple answers. Such questions have "<b>(MA)</b>" in its title. Take into account that, for those questions, the percentages of the bars add up to more than 100%.

+ All questions were optional, but the first one. Each graph tells the number of respondents for each question.

+ Free-text answers have been randomly shuffled, but they are grouped by language, following the order of the "<b>toki seme?</b>" question.

+ In small screens some labels could be hidden or incomplete. You can tap/click on the graphs to reveal the missing info.

## Language used

Most people used the English version of the form. Almost 14% of people used the Toki Pona version, which is greater than last time's 10.8%.

**Btw, [read this post]({% post_url 2022-10-15-musi-supa %}) if you are interested in a board game about language inspired by Toki Pona.**

## Sections filled

One could leave the census after any section. Most people filled everything, as you can see below.

## Do you consider you know Toki Pona?
Anyone with any level of Toki Pona could respond the census, even if they had only just heard about Toki Pona, or if they were learning it. One quarter of people do not consider they know Toki Pona, which is much lower than the one third of last time. Of course, everyone among the Toki Pona respondents considers they know Toki Pona. Except for... 1 person?!?

<div id="22Would you say you know Toki Pona?"></div>
<div id="22Would you say you know Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

## Did you answer the 2021 Toki Pona census?

This is the first surprise. We asked people if they had filled the census that happened 1.5 years before this one. Most people had not filled it, which could indicate that there is a somewhat big turnover in the online communities. Take into account that the number of people that responded to this census is about 2 times as many as last time, so even if everyone filled the census again, this 16.9% could not be bigger than about 50%. Among the Toki Pona respondents, the people that had filled the census last time was 32.4% and this percentage could not be bigger than 41% even if everyone that responded last year using Toki Pona did it again and in Toki Pona. So the difference with respect to the actual value of 32.4% is not huge. Among this group, it could just be that people that had already filled the census 1.5 years ago did not feel like filling it again, or that a small percentage was not so much active during the period the census was running.

However, for the global group, it seems like there is a relatively large turnover of people.

## Toki Pona level
Similarly to last time, the Toki Pona level of respondents is diverse, a normal distribution can be spotted in the global group, and as expected, it is biased towards a greater level for people that responded using the Toki Pona version. 

Tap on the labels on small screens to see them fully.

## How often is Toki Pona used?

The frequency of use also varies a lot. Almost 47% of people use Toki Pona at least once a week and this is about 64% for the Toki Pona group.

## Toki Pona skills
People are generally confident about their grammar skills. At the same time, listening is considered the most challenging task, followed by conversing. Interestingly, the reported level has increased a bit since last time.

## Why do people learn Toki Pona?
The main reason for learning Toki Pona was to have fun by learning it and using it, by a huge margin. At the end of the day, Toki Pona is an artlang. musi mute li kama tan toki pona. Below, you can also see the free answers given for this question.

<div id="22Why did you start learning Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

{% include free_text/22_Why_did_you_start_learning_Toki_Pona.html %}


## When did people start learning Toki Pona?

The exponential increase at almost a rate of 2x per year seems to keep holding a! We got approximately twice as many respondents in the census this year while the census was open for the same amount of time. And now here you can see this exponential growth in the year that people started learning Toki Pona. If we divide the 2021 number by the 2020 number we get 1.95, and if we scaled the 2022 bar by 4/3 (the census was closed in the second week of October so only 3/4 of the year had passed) and divide it by the 2021 one we get 1.88.

Part of this phenomenon could be due to the fact that people that learned Toki Pona more recently hang out more in the communities and have a much higher chance of responding the census. 

But as we pointed out last time, there are other observations showing this exponential growth. At the time of writing, [the number of reddit subscribers to /r/tokipona](https://subredditstats.com/r/tokipona) shows a consistent exponential increase of slightly less than a factor of 2 increase per year. So these data along with the fact that many people here did not fill the census 2021 all seem to indicate that the growth in the online communities is exponential, but at the same time the number of people that leave them or that just don't hang out that much there anymore is also growing exponentially, but the exponential number of people that come in is larger than the one of those that come out.

Also, the exponential cannot be seen for 2022 for the Toki Pona group, most likely because people that recently learned Toki Pona still need some time to be confident enough with the language as to answer the form in Toki Pona.


<div id="22When did you first start learning Toki Pona?"></div>
<div id="22When did you first start learning Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

Here we have the same graph but in logarithmic scale. In this graph, a growth at the pace of a straight line means an exponential increase. One can appreciate how the data grow like a line since at least 2014, with a bump in 2020. This bump (an increase significantly greater than a factor of 2) was not present in the census 2021.

# Community and Toki Pona
---

## Do people own pu or Ku?
A new book by Sonja Lang came out between last census and this one, so we added it to the question about whether you own pu. Despite 83% of people responding a Toki Pona census for the first time, the data were similarly to last time: slightly less than 50% of people own at least one of the books. This notable consistency means that if we knew how many times pu has been sold, by some simple computations one could make a pretty good estimate about the number of jan pi toki pona that are out there.

More people among the group of Toki Pona respondents own the books written or compiled by Sonja Lang.

<div id="22Do you own Toki Pona: The Language of Good (pu) or Toki Pona dictionary (ku) by Sonja Lang?"></div>
<div id="22Do you own Toki Pona: The Language of Good (pu) or Toki Pona dictionary (ku) by Sonja Lang?_tp"></div>


## Non-pu words?
With a new word list that was compiled in the Toki Pona dictionary after the last census, it was pretty natural to ask people whether they know and/or use these words. We asked about the Ku suli words and allowed people to add any other words that they used for Toki Pona. The graph shows the most frequent words that were mentioned (the ones that represent at least 1% of the total) and the rest of the responses can be seen below the graph. Some of these did not use the format we asked for, so they were not considered for the graph. Some people specified the Ku suli words again, and these were not taken into account for the graph either.

The conclusion about these graphs is that except for tonsi, monsuta, kijetesantakalu, ku, and kin, the rest of the words are not used by the majority of people, and more than half of the default list is not even known by most people. So be careful when communicating outside of your bubble! As expected, the people that responded in Toki Pona know most of these words but still, its usage depends a lot on the word. Funnily enough, for this group some words like epiku and oko are used much less in comparison to how much the other words are used with respect to the popularity order in the global group.

In any case I feel there will always be people that think that Toki Pona should stay as a small language, since being small is part of its essence (e.g. just pu words and small additions, or even pu without some words), and there will be others that like to use some other words freely since Toki Pona is all but prescriptive.

## Teaching Toki Pona
Yes, Toki Pona is a language people like teaching! Around 40% of people reported to have taught Toki Pona to other people (100% minus percentage of people that responded with a "No").

<div id="22Have you taught Toki Pona to other people?_tp"></div>
{% include free_text/22_Have_you_taught_Toki_Pona_to_other_people.html %}

## How people learned Toki Pona

The course <i>12 days of Toki Pona by jan Misali</i> keeps being the resource most people used for learning Toki Pona initially. This time even more so, with 61.1% of people selecting this option vs 52.8% last time. We are still in the video era of the internet. pu is still used about the same as last time, while jan Pije's course has declined in favor of jan Lentan's that has increased significantly (jan Pije's is not accesible anymore, which is as far as I know partly because it was teaching a somewhat old version of Toki Pona). In any case, people use multiple resources: the tail of this distribution is fatter than last time and the percentages add up to 221.5% and there is also the resources specified in the free answer part of this question.

<div id="22How did you learn Toki Pona?_tp"></div>
{% include free_text/22_How_did_you_learn_Toki_Pona.html %}

## Communities
Discord and Reddit are still the most represented communities. Interestingly, the percentage of people in Discord has grown from 74.1% to 86.3% and the Reddit one has decreased from 65.6% to 55.1%. This is despite the exponential growth we showed on Reddit above, which just means that the Discord community has been growing even faster! Some new platforms have got Toki Pona communities, like Mastodon and VRChat, which we have extracted from the free answer part of this question.

Remember you can click on the bars to see their labels and numbers if they are missing in small screens.

{% include free_text/22_What_Toki_Pona_communities_are_you_in.html %}

## Particles - head nouns
Unsurprisingly, most people use jan as head nouns before their names. There is a non-insignificant number of people using other head nouns. For instance, a consistent 4% of people use kulupu, which is commonly used by plural systems.

{% include free_text/22_Which_head_nouns_before_your_name_do_you_use_for_y.html %}


## Toki Pona media
This time many more people have consumed Toki Pona songs and videos, most likely due to the new content of this kind that has been produced since last census. Memes in /r/mi_lon are still going strong. lipu tenpo stays about the same and only a few people in proportion have checked other contents. I encourage you to check them out, they are very cool things. For instance, [jan Pepa en soweli Kawa](https://www.peppercarrot.com/tp/webcomics/index.html) is a favorite of mine.

{% include free_text/22_What_Toki_Pona_media_have_you_consumed.html %}

## Writing systems
The data regarding writing systems is quite similar to the last census. The only significant difference is that now 71% of people reported to at least know sitelen pona, while this figure was 61% before. This might be due to new better systems to write and interact with sitelen pona in different platforms and the ensuing new content created in sitelen pona. It is nice that so many people are learning sitelen pona. To put this number in perspective, more people report to know sitelen pona than people that report that they know 8 or more of the 17 Ku suli words.

## Sign languages of Toki Pona

As last time, almost nobody knows any sign language of Toki Pona. Although a significant number of people are interested and were interested last time, very few people have learned it. The number of people that know any Toki Pona signed language has increased though: from 5 to 9 people for toki pona luka and from 1 to 10 for Luka Pona. We show the regular plots and then the same plots with logarithmic so the bars are wide enough for you to click on them and see the numbers.

## Age
Around half of the people responding were under 20, and around a third are in their 20s. Note that most bars specify a range of 10 years but we asked about the 20s by using two ranges. People that responded using Toki Pona tend to be older. The number of people under 20 has increased from 47% to 52.1% since last time, indicating that many of the new people in the community are in this segment. 

<div id="22How old are you?"></div>
<div id="22How old are you?_tp"></div>

## Region

Toki Pona is known all around the globe. The biggest communities are in North America and Europe. Again, take into account that this doesn't necessarily  mean an overwhelming majority of people that know Toki Pona live in North America or Europe, just that the respondents were from these places. In proportion, the North America segment grew more than the Europe one, which could mean that the rate of growth for the North America Toki Pona community is larger.

<div id="22What continent/region are you from? "></div>
<div id="22What continent/region are you from? _tp"></div>

## Gender
Once more, more people reported that their gender is tonsi than people specifying meli. There were many more mije than anything else. However, note that the percentage for meli increased from 18.7% to 24% and correspondingly the one for mije decreased from 64.3% to 55.9%. Also, this time there is a slight higher multiplicity of answers: last time, percentages added up to 128.4% and this time they add up to 136.5%.

There are not very big differences between the global and the Toki Pona segments, except maybe slightly less people identifying as tonsi in the Toki Pona group.

# Languages

## How many languages do tokiponists know?
Despite that this year more people reported to know Toki Pona, the percentage of people speaking exactly 1 or 2 languages has increased, while the one for 3 languages remains the same and the one for 4, 5 and 6 languages decreased. Note that this year we specified that you would speak these languages with some degree of fluency, which could account for the change in the data. Around 5% of people said they know 6 or more languages, some of which could be other conlangs.

<div id="22In how many languages can you converse with some degree of fluency? (including Toki Pona)"></div>
<div id="22In how many languages can you converse with some degree of fluency? (including Toki Pona)_tp"></div>

## What languages do tokiponists know? 

Most people are fluent in English. There is a great variety of languages represented here. Because this year we allowed to specify a language with its level, we got more information that was not there before. For instance, there is a large amount of people that are learning or know a bit of Japanese, despite that there are not so many fluent Japanese speakers. This new data also show that many people are learning or know a bit of Finnish and American sign language, which were two languages that scored much lower last time when we only asked whether you knew the languages.

The original options of this question were chosen to be the most common languages selected in the last census. People could indicate other languages that they knew and any relationship they had with them. In the graph, all languages that appeared at least 5 times (0.3%) are depicted. This question asked for your level in the language, so if you did not indicate it, this datum was not used for the graph. Some people specified again languages that were asked in the two questions with options (conlangs and default natural languages). These were not counted twice. We show the global plot twice: once with a regular scale, in order to appreciate the proportions, and another one with logarithmic scale, in order to make it easy to read it for the languages that were not so common. The free answer data was too sparse among the toki pona respondents, so we did not use it for the plot. In the free answer box below, all the data appears (the one that was used for the graph and the one that was not)

## What conlangs do tokiponists know? 
A significant amount of people (around one out of four) knows at least another conlang besides Toki Pona. This number has decreased from around one out of three from last time. Esperanto is the most commonly known conlang. Note that the scale here is logarithmic as well, in order to visualize the unfrequently known languages well.

# Free-answer section

We asked people to add anything else they wanted and we received many responses. Throughout all the census, we published the data as it is. In this section, we removed a couple of messages that were private messages directed to us regarding removing previous duplicated responses due to errors or misunderstandings, which we did.

Thanks to everyone for participating! See you maybe at the next one, for which we will probably wait more time than what we did last time. Until then: o musi kepeken toki pona.
