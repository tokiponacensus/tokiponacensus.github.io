How has the Toki Pona community evolved since August 2022? Is it still growing exponentially? How do people find out about Toki Pona? What do people create in Toki Pona most often?
Find about this and much more in the results to the third Toki Pona census!

August 08, 2024. After 2 years since the second census, the third one is released on Toki Pona's anniversary. We closed it after 6 weeks, as last times, receiving 1997 responses, which is about the same as last time.

Hi, I'm jan Tamalu and I have coordinated this project, analyzed the data, and made this post. 
Many people contributed to this project, such as mun Kekan San, kala Asi, lipamanka, jan Malin, jan Pensa, and jan Tepo. Also, jan Kuku offered to send a free copy of the [su book](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/su) anywhere in the world to a random person that filled the census and wanted to enter the raffle by indicating some form of contact. We selected one at random among the 842 that decided to participate and have contacted this person. We'll edit this post when this person replies or we'll select another one at random after some time if we get no reply.  

In this edition, we had some new questions and others were slightly modified. The turnover of people replying the census was again very high, reinforcing the idea that this is a phenomenon that happens in the online community. o lukin pona a!


<b>What to know before jumping to the results:</b>

+ In small screens some labels could be hidden or incomplete. You can tap/click on the graphs to reveal the missing info. 

+ Each question has (1) a graph with results from <b>all</b> the responses (including tp respondents) and (2) one with results from the people that used the Toki Pona version of the form.

+ Some questions allowed multiple answers and have "<b>(MA)</b>" in its title. For those questions, the percentages in the bars add up to more than 100%.

+ All questions were optional, but the first one. Each graph tells the number of respondents for each question.

+ Free-text answers have been randomly shuffled but separated by whether people responded in Toki Pona.

# Intro

## Language used

We used a Google form in English and Toki Pona and a Tencent QQ form in Chinese and Toki Pona, since Google is banned in China. 

The respondents in Toki Pona increased to about 16% from the almost 14% from 2022 and the 10.8% of 2021. This percentage highly correlates with the people that reported to have an advanced or fluent level, whereas people with an intermediate level or below tend to prefer answering the census in English.

**Btw, I created [a Discord server](https://discord.gg/9dByQ3JT) for playing and contributing to a game inspired by Toki Pona designed to grow the Toki Pona community. [This is a post about it]({% post_url 2025-05-31-musi-supa %}).**

## Sections filled

One could leave the census after any section. Most people filled everything, as you can see below. This is in line with previous years.

## Do you consider you know Toki Pona?
Anyone with any level of Toki Pona could respond the census, even if they had only just heard about Toki Pona, or were in the process of learning it. About 80% of respondents consider they know Toki Pona, which increased from the 74.2% of 2022. This difference is roughly the same amount as the increase in people that used the Toki Pona version of the census (321 vs 264), so this is probably explained by a growth in the segment of people mastering Toki Pona, and by them staying in the online communities more than the other segment.

There were 8 brave people that used the Toki Pona form that do not consider they know Toki Pona.


<div id="24Would you say you know Toki Pona?"></div>
<div id="24Would you say you know Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

## Did you answer previous Toki Pona censuses?

Similarly as last time, the percentage of respondents that were filling the census for the first time is very large. Now it's about 78% versus the 83% of last time, which is natural since now there were two previous censuses. A similar thing happens for the segment responding in Toki Pona, although people in this segment answered previous censuses in greater proportion. 

In any case, these data keep indicating that the turnover of the people in the online communities is very large. This rotation makes it difficult to estimate the amount of people that learned Toki Pona by using a single census.

Interestingly, as you will see in the sequel, the results for most answers are very similar across years, despite of different people responding the census. It's like the distribution of people that learn Toki Pona has a specific profile, that we can observe with every fresh sample of the census.

<div id='24What previous Toki Pona censuses did you answer to?'></div>
<div id="24What previous Toki Pona censuses did you answer to?_tp"></div>

## Toki Pona level
As in previous times, the Toki Pona level of respondents is spread, but a kind of normal distribution can be spotted in the global group, and it is biased towards a greater level for people that answered using Toki Pona. Generally the reported level of Toki Pona increased with respect to 2022, with now 53% of people reporting at least a conversation level, versus 44% from last time.

Tap on the labels on small screens to see them fully.

<div id="24What level of ability in Toki Pona do you have?_tp"></div>

## How often is Toki Pona used?

The frequency of use also varies a lot across people, while the distribution is similar to the last census. About 49% of people use Toki Pona at least once a week and this is about 64% for the Toki Pona group.

<div id="24How often do you use (read/listen/write/speak) Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

## Toki Pona skills

Similarly to last time, people are confident about their grammar skills, whereas listening is the most challenging task, followed by conversing. Interestingly, the reported level has generally increased in both the global group and the Toki Pona group.

<div id="24Which of these are true for you?"></div>
<div id="24Which of these are true for you?_tp"></div>

## Sign languages of Toki Pona

As in previous times, very few people know sign languages related to Toki Pona. 
Although a significant number of people are interested, and were also interested previously, very few people consider they have learned. However, the number of people that are learning luka pona more than doubled since last time. 

A surprising fact this time, is the great increase of people that learned or are learning toki pona luka (pu) despite Sonja Lang retiring it and fully endorsing luka pona. This number is 119 (vs 37 from last time) and this mostly comes from people that did not respond the form in Toki Pona. Also, a few people created and learned their own sign language.

Below, you can see the regular plots and then the same plots in logarithmic scale so the bars are wide enough for you to click on them and see the numbers.

## Why do people learn Toki Pona?
The main reason for learning Toki Pona was to have fun by learning it and using it, by a large margin. Let's not forget Toki Pona was born as an artlang. The percentage of people in the second answer increased by 15% in the global group. Below, you can also see the free answers given for this question.

{% include free_text/24_Why_did_you_start_learning_Toki_Pona.html %}

## How did people first hear about Toki Pona?

This is a new question! And it is a very interesting one to me. We are seeing that responses in the censuses are similar across editions despite of the turnover of people. So the profile of people that learn Toki Pona is roughly not changing. Could this be because people that are alike teach about Toki Pona to each other, in a network effect? Or is it just that people with these kinds of profiles are more likely to find about Toki Pona and decide to learn it, independently? The following data indicate that the second option is probably the correct one. 

Most people find about Toki Pona online. Note that the proportions of the second fourth answers are quite different between the Toki Pona and the global segments, but this is probably due to the answer using jan poka instead of jan pona. In the free answer field you can see many responses, but people answering "jan Misali" stand out.

{% include free_text/24_How_did_you_first_hear_about_Toki_Pona.html %}


## When did people start learning Toki Pona?

This is one big change with respect to previous editions. Previously, it'd seem as if the community was growing exponentially at a rate of 2x per year. However, this year we got about the same amount of respondents as in 2022 whereas the censuses where open for the same amount of time in the same time of the year.


At the time of writing, [the number of reddit subscribers to /r/tokipona](https://subredditstats.com/r/tokipona) has slowed down from an exponential curve to roughly a linear one for the last few years (which is still growth!). One may think that this is due to the end of the COVID effect, where people spent more time online. 

If one looks at the data in the global segment in the logarithmic scale (below you have a normal scale and a logarithmic one), and one adjusts for the fact that the year 2024 was not complete when the census came out, one can still appreciate a kind of linear growth (although slowed down in the last years), which in logarithmic scales means an exponential growth. However, this can also be explained by people leaving the online communities at a fixed rate every year that passes since they learned, similarly to what we see in the turnover of people replying previous censuses

Of course, as last times, the curve drops in the year of the census and the previous one in the Toki Pona segment, since newer speakers are less likely to respond in Toki Pona.

<div id="24When did you first start learning Toki Pona?"></div>
<div id="24When did you first start learning Toki Pona?_tp"></div>

Here we have the same graph but in logarithmic scale. In this graph, a growth at the pace of a straight line means an exponential increase.

# Community and Toki Pona

## Do people own the language official books?

We asked whether people owned the two official books that describe or document Toki Pona and its usage. 

Despite of the fact that most people responded the census for the first time, the distribution for all the answers is again strikingly similar to previous times. It seems that across time and people, a bit less than 50% of people buy at least one of the official books! Also, about 25% buy both. The people that responded in Toki Pona own the books in a greater proportion. 

<div id="24Do you own the official books about Toki Pona?"></div>
<div id="24Do you own the official books about Toki Pona?_tp"></div>


## Non-pu words?

Both using and knowing the meaning of each of the words we asked about increased since 2022. Below one can see that 11 words are used by at least half of the people, while this number was only 5 in 2021. Of course, people responding in Toki Pona know more about the meanings of these words. These words are used in greater proportion than for the global segment, but not much more, especially for the bottom half.

We also asked people to indicate what other words they used. We gathered the most common ones, which naturally, are reported much less than the words we asked about. Below the graph you can see the rest of responses. As indicated by the form, we only used the data whose format was like "word, word, word - a comment".

{% include free_text/24_Do_you_use_any_other_non-pu_words.html %}

## Teaching Toki Pona
About 47% of respondents report to have taught Toki Pona to other people (100% minus the percentage of people answering "No"), increasing from the 40% of 2021. Keep it going!

## How people learned Toki Pona

This question was updated this year since new courses were created and became popular since last time. The course <i>12 days of Toki Pona by jan Misali</i> keeps being the resource most people used for learning Toki Pona initially. This option went down to 52% after being 61% last time but 52.8% in 2021. Then, pu and ma pona follow the lead and the lessons by jan Kekan San gets fourth place. About 10% of people use Anki or Memrise to support their learning, similar to last times. In general, the trend is for older courses to be used less, and the video courses to increase in popularity. Below the labels have been simplified for better readability, the actual questions were longer and more detailed (e.g. "Learn Toki Pona!" specified: videos or written lessons).

{% include free_text/24_How_did_you_learn_Toki_Pona.html %}

## Communities
Discord is the biggest home for Toki Pona online. It's prevalence has stayed the same as last time in the global segment, whereas it has increased from 81% to 88% for people using the Toki Pona version of the census. Reddit has dropped a bit, and so have Facebook and X (former Twitter). On the other hand, Mastodon and VR Chat grew a bit.

## Head nouns

Most people use jan as the word before their name, but this dropped to about 80% from the last time's 90%. People could specify they didn't use head nouns by writing 'X'.

## Toki Pona media
We changed this question a bit, in order to ask about categories rather than mostly about specific works, since now the number of works in Toki Pona has greatly grown. People consume all sorts of media in Toki Pona. Songs, memes and videos are at the top, but the other categories don't fall short. Note that the answers in Toki Pona included examples and more descriptive labels in order to identify them, but we have shorten them for better readability.

Recall that [here]({% post_url 2025-05-01-resources_mentioned_in_census %}) you have Toki Pona resources and media mentioned in the census. They are very cool, check them out!

## Toki Pona creations

This is a new question a! About 60% of people report to have created something in Toki Pona (100% minus the negative answer). Translations are the most common contribution to the community, whereas 15% of people wrote original works in Toki Pona. 

People love creating new writing systems. Also number systems. I even have [my own](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nasin_nanpa_ali_ike#%5Bdecimal%5D_%5Bpu_words%5D_nanpa_Pi,_tan_jan_Tamalu) and [a variation](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nasin_nanpa_ali_ike#[decimal]_[pu_words]_nasin_nanpa_Wan,_tan_jan_Tamalu) both allowing to express decimal, negative and big numbers, for fun, a a a.

About 9% of people create Toki Pona's learning material. We have a very hard working community!

## Writing systems

The results in this question are very similar to last time. Except for sitelen pona, where 85% of people report to know it, versus 71% in 2022 and 61% in 2021. It's becoming more popular! I want to thank everyone making sitelen pona more usable, which has surely contributed to this. News!: An <b>official</b> stable standard is to be announced soon in [sitelenpona.org](sitelenpona.org), aimed for Unicode and more.

## Age
Around 48% of respondents were under 20 versus the 52% of last time. Also, 35% are in their 20s versus 32% from last time. The community has aged slightly, which is only natural, it also happened in 2022 versus 2021. People that respond using Toki Pona tend to be older.
<div id="24How old are you?"></div>
<div id="24How old are you?_tp"></div>

## Region

Toki Pona is known all around the globe. The biggest communities are in North America and Europe, where this year Europeans are slighly more represented, and the proportion of people from Asia increased a bit. For the Toki Pona segments, there were fewer changes.

<div id="24What continent/region are you from? "></div>

## Gender


The gender distribution is very similar as in 2022, with more people reporting that their gender is tonsi than people specifying meli. However, the sum of the percentages is increasing over time, which means higher multiplicity in answers. It's 142% in 2024 versus 136.5% in 2022 and 128.4% in 2021.

There are not significant differences in the gender distribution between the global and the Toki Pona segments.

## Religion

No significant differences can be observed between these data and the ones in 2022. There is a slightly greater proportion of people selecting atheism and agnosticism. Below I simplified the labels, but the form had a more comprehensive description in Toki Pona.

## How many languages do tokiponists know?


We get a very similar distribution as last time, with no statistically significant changes.

<div id="24In how many languages can you converse with some degree of fluency? (including Toki Pona)_tp"></div>

## What languages do tokiponists know? 

We show the global plot twice: once with a regular scale, in order to appreciate the proportions, and another one with logarithmic scale, in order to make it easy to read it for the languages that were not so common.

As in 2022, the original options of this question were chosen to be the most common languages selected in the last census. You could indicate more languages in the free-answer field. 

There is probably an slight excess of "learning / know a bit" answers since some people seem to have thought they had to select at least one option. This could be fixed next time by providing a fourth option.

## What conlangs do tokiponists know? 
Three out of ten people know at least another conlang besides Toki Pona. This has slighly increased since last time, and is slightly lower than what was reported in 2021. It's probably not a trend but random noise. Esperanto is the most commonly known conlang. Note that the scale here is logarithmic as well, in order to visualize the unfrequently known languages well.

  <summary><b>Bonus Data: When did people fill the census? Click to expand</b></summary>

This year I put together the data from all previous years to show when people filled the census. Essentially, one sees two peaks in the first and second censuses and three in the 2024 one. These peaks corresponds to a global reminder in all online communities we could reach, which includes a global ping in ma pona pi toki pona on Discord. Note that all the censuses were open for about the same amount of days. The initial horizontal orange lines in 2022 and 2024 are due to responses made by the working team before releasing to the public.
